Exploitation:

1. Click the copyright symbol(Â©) at the bottom of any page.
2. Inspect Element
3. Inside the middle section called '<!-- Main -->' find the sentence, "You must be cumming from : "https://www.nsa.gov/" to go to the next step"
4. Execute the shellscript "sh nsa.sh", a simple script to fake the referer.
5. The flag will appear in terminal.

Resolution:
Referer is not a good option. Find a more optimal way to validate referrals in the specific language your site is using.

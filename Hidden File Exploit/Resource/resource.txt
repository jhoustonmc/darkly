Exploitation:

All files and directories of a website can be accessed by the user unless protected against.

1. Execute the shellscript "sh hidden.sh", a simple script that downloads all files in the "./hidden" directory.
2. After the script has been completed, the flag can be found in the terminal.

Resolution:

Use a .htaccess file for apache (use an equivalent setting for whatever webserver you're using) to restrict unwanted access to specific files or directories.
